# baseline
I reload my systems *a lot*. This is a collection of scripts that allow me to choose my environment and have a working system within minutes.

*NOT* meant for public consumption, this is just a tool I use to baseline my workstations and laptops. If you find use from parts, that's great but it's not meant to be a generic public tool. Use at your own risk!
